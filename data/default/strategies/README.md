## How It Works

1. **Import** a strategy into Yojin via the web UI (paste Markdown or fetch from URL)
2. **Activate** the strategy on the Skills page or through the Strategist agent
3. **Yojin evaluates** trigger conditions against your portfolio data
4. **When triggers fire**, the Strategist reads the strategy content and proposes actions in the Intel Feed

Strategies are Markdown files with structured YAML frontmatter. The frontmatter defines machine-readable trigger conditions and metadata. The body is free-form Markdown that the Strategist agent reads as natural-language instructions for thesis, entry/exit rules, and risk controls.

## Writing a Strategy

A good strategy file has:

- **Clear frontmatter** with accurate trigger conditions and data requirements
- **Thesis section** explaining why the strategy works, with academic or empirical backing
- **Entry rules** that are specific and unambiguous
- **Exit rules** covering both profit-taking and stop-loss scenarios
- **Risk controls** with concrete position limits, sector caps, and timing restrictions

Use the existing strategies as templates. The Strategist agent interprets the Markdown body as instructions, so write as if you're explaining the strategy to a knowledgeable trader.

## Attribution

The seed strategies in this collection are inspired by concepts described in *151 Trading Strategies* by Zura Kakushadze and Juan Andrés Serur (2018). The strategy descriptions here are original works that adapt well-established academic concepts for use with Yojin's agent system. They do not reproduce text from the paper. The underlying trading strategies (momentum, value, mean-reversion, etc.) are widely documented in the financial literature and are not proprietary to any single publication.
