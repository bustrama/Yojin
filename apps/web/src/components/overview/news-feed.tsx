        "Apple's enterprise AI play leverages its unique advantage: on-device processing with Apple Silicon. While competitors rely on cloud AI, Apple's approach addresses the #1 enterprise concern — data privacy. The SAP/Salesforce partnerships are strategic, embedding Apple Intelligence into existing enterprise workflows. This move could accelerate iPhone and iPad refresh cycles in the enterprise segment (currently ~28% of device revenue). The $8-12B revenue estimate from analysts may be conservative if adoption follows the pattern of enterprise iPad deployments.",
